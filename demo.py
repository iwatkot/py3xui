# In this short example we will update the client's traffic limit.
# Due to the way API returns the data, we need to get the needed inbound to
# obtain the actual UUID of the client.
# Becaue other endpoints return the numeric ID of the client in the given inbound,
# not the UUID.
# In the same way it can be implemented for AsyncApi, the methods are called
# exactly the same way, and has the same signatures.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an instance of the API class.
